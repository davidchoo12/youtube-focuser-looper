# youtube-focuser-looper
Chrome extension that sets focus into YouTube videos for keyboard shortcuts to be automatically available and adds a loop video button.

manifest.json contains stuff required for a chrome extension, basically like a config file

popup.html contains, well you guessed it, the html file for the popup dialog

myscript.js contains the fun part :)

PS: the icon is initially meant for only youtube focuser which i built quite some time ago. i only built the looper (in a day :p) after my exam, which also explains the version if any of you notice. and i like it simple so im not gonna add a loop icon around it.
