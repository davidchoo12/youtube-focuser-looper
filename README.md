# youtube-focuser-looper
Chrome extension that sets focus into YouTube videos for keyboard shortcuts to be automatically available and adds a loop video button.

manifest.json contains stuff required for a chrome extension, basically like a config file
popup.html contains, well you guessed it, the html file for the popup dialog
myscript.js contains the fun part :)
